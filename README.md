A good expense tracker app should be clear and simple
This means:
Easy Screens: The app shouldn't be confusing. You should be able to add expenses, sort them by category (like groceries or rent), and see reports quickly.
Graphs and Charts: Charts and graphs turn numbers into pictures, making it easy to see where your money goes.
